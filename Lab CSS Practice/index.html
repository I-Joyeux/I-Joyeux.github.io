      <P>LANGLEY, VA&#8212;A report released 
        Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the 
        Inspector General revealed that the 
        CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds
        of thousands of pages of critical 
        intelligence information with black highlighters.
        </P>

        <p>
            According to the report, sections of 
            the documents&#8212; "almost invariably the 
            most crucial passages"&#8212;are marred by 
            an indelible black ink that renders the 
            lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret 
            highlighting policy that began at the agency's 
            inception in 1947. 
        </p>

        <p>
            CIA Director <b> porter Goss</b> lamented 
            the fact that the public will probably 
            never know the particulars of several 
            historic events, such as:

          <ul>
            <li> the Cold War</li>
            <li> the civil-rights movement</li>
            <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
            
          </ul>
        </p>
