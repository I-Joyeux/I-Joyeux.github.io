                    <p>In 8th grade, I started playing around with “code”, 
                        I took computer science. in that class, we would use scratch to make the Sphero move. 
                        This class opened my eyes to what a programming language is. which are just sets of rules 
                        for the computer to follow/execute.

                    <p> In my sophomore and junior years, I took networking. although it wasn’t for me it gave 
                        me a behind the scenes of what it takes for a  simple local network to work and an understanding
                        of how the Internet works as a whole.

                    <p>The summer after my sophomore year I got a job at a nearby Subway 
                        I’ve been working there since. After working there for a while I got promoted to shift lead since 
                        I couldn’t be an assistant manager with the school. Throughout all this time, I've learned how to lead 
                        by example and making sure things run smoothly on a day-by-day basis.

                    <p>I am currently a student College of Western Idaho (CWi) in my first 
                        semester working towards my associate in software development. since the 8th grade when 
                        I was telling a sphere to move in scratch, I knew it was what I wanted to do as a career. 
                        Now I am just trying to make that dream a reality.
